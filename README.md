[00:06.96] The Day I opened up memory's Door
[00:12.00] I Found something that I Could live for
[00:17.87] Curtains shook as you opened my eyes
[00:22.06] And light came rushing inside
[00:26.47] Data behind my heart's encryptiton key
[00:27.88] (Can you see?)
[00:31.81] Listen and you might hear a melody
[00:37.76] Your fire sparked the passion that keeps burning
[00:42.17] Magic that helps me to believe
[00:45.63] All the colors of the night
[00:48.56] and the way they help you hide
[00:49.97] I'm learning what it's
[00:52.45] like to love and be alive
[00:56.34] Oh there will always be a tomorrow
[00:58.67] You'll never have to be alone
[01:00.08] Diamond City Lights
[01:01.73] illuminate what's inside
[01:03.84] And all the love I feel by your side
[01:05.39] Decording these emotions,
[01:09.14] you're the ocean I wanna dive into tonight
[01:12.20] Raindow-colored skies invite us to take a ride
[01:16.04] I know time won't wait 'cause it only leaves behind
[01:20.92] Don't cry look in my eyes and you might find
[01:26.30] A shimmering light that will guide you through the night
[01:37.71] When gray skies take the colors away
[01:39.12] (far away)
[01:43.33] I'll paint a rainbow lasting for days and days
[01:49.35] Just like the magic that you always shared with me
[01:54.01] Maybe now you need to believe
[01:56.69] As the hands of time progress,
[01:59.60] it's so easy to forget
[02:03.60] The miracle that helped you bring me to life
[02:07.56] Oh, these will always be a tomorrow
[02:09.71] We'll never have to be alone
[02:12.87] Diamond City Lights illuminate what's inside
[02:15.04] And all the love I feel by your side
[02:20.50] Decording these emotions, you're the ocean I wanna dive into tonight
[02:23.42] Rainbow-colored skies invite us take a ride
[02:27.37] I know time won't wait 'cause it only leaves behind
[02:31.26] Don't cry, lock in my eyes and you might find
[02:34.64] A Shimmering light, now let me guide you
[02:43.87] ---
[02:54.10] ---
[02:56.61] Let's go to the place
[02:59.32] Let's go to the place
[03:05.10] Let's go to the place where our happiness won't fade away
[03:10.04] If you could only see the joy you've showed to me
[03:18.53] I think you would realize everything we could be...
[03:21.45] Diamond City Lights illuminate what's inside
[03:23.57] And all the love I feel by your side
[03:28.84] Decording these emotions, you're the ocean I wanna dive into tonight
[03:31.97] Rainbow-colored skies invite us to take a ride
[03:35.91] I know time won't wait 'cause it only leaves behind
[03:39.75] Don't cry, look in my eyes and you might find
[03:44.47] A Shimmering light that will guide you through the night
[03:50.15] Diamond light, rainbow skies
[03:52.69] In the night these's no need to hide
[03:55.49] The joy in your eyes fills me with life
[04:01.32] So let it shine!
